<p>(c-5) When a pharmacist is not present in the pharmacy, a registered pharmacy technician, registered certified pharmacy technician, student pharmacist, or other supportive staff shall sell prescriptions that have received final verification by a pharmacist. A registered pharmacy technician, registered certified pharmacy technician, student pharmacist, or other supportive staff shall connect a patient to a pharmacist to provide counseling by audio or video technology for any prescription that requires counseling by a pharmacist. If the pharmacy does not have audio and video technology to connect the patient or other individual who is picking up the prescription on behalf of the patient to a pharmacist to provide counseling, then a telephone number at which the patient or other individual who is picking up the prescription on behalf of the patient can be reached shall be obtained. The pharmacist, upon returning to duty, shall attempt to contact the patient or other individual in accordance with items (iii) and (iv) of subsection (c). It shall be the responsibility of the pharmacy and pharmacist-in-charge to ensure that all staff, including supportive staff, are trained in selling pre-verified prescriptions. Training shall include, at a minimum, recordkeeping requirements, patient counseling protocols as described in this subsection (c-5), pharmacy safety protocols, and patient privacy standards. The prescription record shall contain the names, initials, or other unique identifier of both the pharmacist who verified the prescription and the staff member who sold the prescription.</p>

<p>Sec. 15.3. Emergency prescription refills.</p>

<p>A pharmacist may exercise professional judgment to dispense an emergency supply of medication for a chronic disease or condition if the pharmacist is unable to obtain refill authorization from the prescriber when:</p>

<ol>
  <li>in the pharmacist's professional judgment, interruption of therapy might reasonably produce undesirable consequences or cause patient suffering;</li>
  <li>the pharmacy previously dispensed or refilled a prescription from the prescriber for the same patient and medication;</li>
  <li>the prescription is not for a controlled substance;</li>
  <li>the pharmacist informs the patient or the patient's agent at the time of dispensing that prescriber authorization is required for future refills; notification may be made verbally, electronically, or in writing; and</li>
  <li>the emergency dispensing is documented in the patient's prescription record and the pharmacist informs the prescriber of the emergency refill.</li>
</ol>

<p>The emergency supply must be limited to the amount needed for the emergency period as determined by the pharmacist within his or her professional judgment. However, the total amount dispensed shall not exceed a 30-day supply.</p>

<p>(a) Uncoordinated multiple controlled substances and drug seeking tendencies pose a significant threat to the health, safety, and welfare of patients. To address this threat, the General Assembly believes a physician who prescribes controlled substances should be provided with prescription information from pharmacies.</p>

<p>(b) Upon request, a pharmacist shall provide a physician licensed to practice medicine in all its branches who is prepared to prescribe or has prescribed a controlled substance for a patient with information from the patient's most recent patient profile, including information about any prescriptions for controlled substances.</p>

<p>The General Assembly finds that this Section is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety.</p>

<p>In this Section, "facility-provided medication" means any topical antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, dilation, or glaucoma drop or ointment.</p>

<p>When a facility-provided medication is ordered at least 24 hours in advance for a surgical procedure and is administered to a patient at the facility, any unused portion of the facility-provided medication must be offered to the patient upon discharge when it is required for continuing treatment.</p>

<p>A facility-provided medication shall be labeled consistent with labeling requirements under Section 22.</p>

<p>If the facility-provided medication is used in an operating room or emergency department setting, the prescriber is responsible for counseling the patient on its proper use and administration and the requirement of pharmacist counseling is waived.</p>

<p>It is the duty of every pharmacist in charge who ceases to function in that capacity to report to the Department within 30 days of the date on which he ceased such functions for such pharmacy. It is the duty of every owner of a pharmacy licensed under this Act to report to the Department within 30 days of the date on which the pharmacist in charge died or ceased to function in that capacity and to specify a new pharmacist in charge. Failure to provide such notification to the Department shall be grounds for disciplinary action.</p>

</ul>

<p>A pharmacist may substitute an interchangeable biological product for a prescribed biological product only if all of the following conditions in this subsection (b) are met:</p>

  <li>(d) An automated pharmacy system operated from a remote site shall be under the continuous supervision of a home pharmacy pharmacist. To qualify as continuous supervision, the pharmacist is not required to be physically present at the site of the automated pharmacy system if the system is supervised electronically by a pharmacist, as defined by rule.</li>
  <li>(e) Drugs may only be dispensed at a remote site through an automated pharmacy system after receipt of an original prescription drug order by a pharmacist at the home pharmacy. A pharmacist at the home pharmacy must control all operations of the automated pharmacy system and approve the release of the initial dose of a prescription drug order. Refills from an approved prescription drug order may be removed from the automated medication system after this initial approval. Any change made in the prescription drug order shall require a new approval by a pharmacist to release the drug.</li>
  <li>(f) If an automated pharmacy system uses removable cartridges or containers to store a drug, the stocking or restocking of the cartridges or containers may occur at a licensed wholesale drug distributor and be sent to the home pharmacy to be loaded after pharmacist verification by personnel designated by the pharmacist, provided that the individual cartridge or container is transported to the home pharmacy in a secure, tamper evident container. An automated pharmacy system must use a bar code verification or weight verification or electronic verification or similar process to ensure that the cartridge or container is accurately loaded into the automated pharmacy system. The pharmacist verifying the filling and labeling shall be responsible for ensuring that the cartridge or container is stocked or restocked correctly by personnel designated to load the cartridges or containers. An automated pharmacy system must use a bar code verification, electronic, or similar process, as defined by rule, to ensure that the proper medication is dispensed from the automated system. A record of each transaction with the automated pharmacy system must be maintained for 5 years.

<p>(i) Members of the Board shall have no liability in any action based upon any disciplinary proceedings or other activity performed in good faith as a member of the Board. The Attorney General shall defend all such actions unless he or she determines either that there would be a conflict of interest in such representation or that the actions complained of were not in good faith or were willful and wanton. If the Attorney General declines representation, the member shall have the right to employ counsel of his or her choice, whose fees shall be provided by the State, after approval by the Attorney General, unless there is a determination by a court that the member's actions were not in good faith or were willful and wanton. The member must notify the Attorney General within 7 days of receipt of notice of the initiation of any action involving services of the Board. Failure to so notify the Attorney General shall constitute an absolute waiver of the right to a defense and indemnification.

<p>Sec. 30.1. Reporting.</p>

<p>(a) When a pharmacist, registered certified pharmacy technician, or a registered pharmacy technician licensed by the Department is terminated for actions which may have threatened patient safety, the pharmacy or pharmacist-in-charge, pursuant to the policies and procedures of the pharmacy at which he or she is employed, shall report the termination to the chief pharmacy coordinator. Such reports shall be strictly confidential and may be reviewed and considered only by the members of the Board or by authorized Department staff. Such reports, and any records associated with such reports, are exempt from public disclosure and the Freedom of Information Act. Although the reports are exempt from disclosure, any formal complaint filed against a licensee or registrant by the Department or any order issued by the Department against a licensee, registrant, or applicant shall be a public record, except as otherwise prohibited by law. A pharmacy shall not take any adverse action, including, but not limited to, disciplining or terminating a pharmacist, registered certified pharmacy technician, or registered pharmacy technician, as a result of an adverse action against the person's license or clinical privileges or other disciplinary action by another state or health care institution that resulted from the pharmacist's, registered certified pharmacy technician's, or registered pharmacy technician's provision of, authorization of, recommendation of, aiding or assistance with, referral for, or participation in any health care service, if the adverse action was based solely on a violation of the other state's law prohibiting the provision such health care and related services in the state or for a resident of the state.</p>

<p>(b) The report shall be submitted to the chief pharmacy coordinator in a timely fashion. Unless otherwise provided in this Section, the reports shall be filed in writing, on forms provided by the Department, within 60 days after a pharmacy's determination that a report is required under this Act. All reports shall contain only the following information:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The name, address, and telephone number of the person making the report.</li>
  <li>The name, license number, and last known address and telephone number of the person who is the subject of the report.</li>
  <li>A brief description of the facts which gave rise to the issuance of the report, including dates of occurrence.</li>
</ol>

<p>(c) The contents of any report and any records associated with such report shall be strictly confidential and may only be reviewed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>members of the Board of Pharmacy;</li>
  <li>the Board of Pharmacy's designated attorney;</li>
  <li>administrative personnel assigned to open mail containing reports, to process and distribute reports to authorized persons, and to communicate with senders of reports;</li>
  <li>Department investigators and Department prosecutors; or</li>
  <li>attorneys from the Office of the Illinois Attorney General representing the Department in litigation in response to specific disciplinary action the Department has taken or initiated against a specific individual pursuant to this Section.</li>
</ul>

<p>(d) Whenever a pharmacy or pharmacist-in-charge makes a report and provides any records associated with that report to the Department, acts in good faith, and not in a willful and wanton manner, the person or entity making the report and the pharmacy or health care institution employing him or her shall not, as a result of such actions, be subject to criminal prosecution or civil damages.</p>

<p>Sec. 30.5. Suspension of license or certificate for failure to pay restitution.</p>

<p>The Department, without further process or hearing, shall suspend the license issued under this Act of any person who has been certified by court order as not having paid restitution to a person under Section 8A-3.5 of the Illinois Public Aid Code or under Section 17-10.5 or 46-1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.</p>

<p>A person whose license or other authorization to practice is suspended under this Section is prohibited from practicing until the restitution is made in full. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/31)  </p>

<p>Sec. 31. The Department may refuse to issue a license to establish a new licensed pharmacy if an owner of the pharmacy applying for a license was an owner of a pharmacy that had its license revoked, unless the owner presents sufficient evidence indicating rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Once a complaint has been filed by the Department against a pharmacy the Department may refuse to issue a license to establish a new licensed pharmacy, until such time as the Department issues a decision on the complaint, if an owner of the new pharmacy was also an owner of a pharmacy against which the complaint was filed.</p>

<p>Neither an application for change of ownership nor for a change of location for any such pharmacy shall be acted on by the Department until such time as the Department issues a decision on the complaint.</p>

<p>In the event that the pharmacy against which the complaint has been filed ceases to be licensed by the Department, for any reason, prior to the Department's decision on the complaint and an owner of that pharmacy applies for a license to establish a new pharmacy, the Department shall conduct a hearing on the complaint earlier filed, regardless of whether that pharmacy is presently licensed by the Department.</p>

<p>If the conduct for which the complaint was originally filed would have been sufficient to result in a revocation of a license to operate a licensed pharmacy, then such conduct shall constitute sufficient grounds for denial of an application for a license.</p>

<p>For purposes of this Section "owner" means a sole proprietor, partner or a shareholder who owns in excess of 5 percent of the outstanding shares of a corporation, or the spouse or children of such sole proprietor, partner or shareholder.</p>

<p>The provision of this Section shall not apply to any pharmacy owned by a corporation whose shares of stock are publicly traded on a national stock exchange. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/32)  </p>
<p>Sec. 32. The Department shall render no final administrative decision relative to any application for a license under this Act if the applicant for such license is the subject of a pending disciplinary proceeding under this Act or another Act administered by the Department. For purposes of this Section "applicant" means an individual or sole proprietor, or an individual who is an officer, director or owner of a 5 percent or more beneficial interest of the applicant. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/33)  </p>

<p>Sec. 33. The Secretary may, upon receipt of a written communication from the Secretary of Human Services, the Director of Healthcare and Family Services (formerly Director of Public Aid), or the Director of Public Health that continuation of practice of a person licensed or registered under this Act constitutes an immediate danger to the public, immediately suspend the license of such person without a hearing.</p>

<p>In instances in which the Secretary immediately suspends a license under this Act, a hearing upon such person's license must be convened by the Board within 15 days after such suspension and completed without appreciable delay, such hearing held to determine whether to recommend to the Secretary that the person's license be revoked, suspended, placed on probationary status or restored, or such person be subject to other disciplinary action.</p>

<p>In such hearing, the written communication and any other evidence submitted therewith may be introduced as evidence against such person; provided however, the person, or his counsel, shall have the opportunity to discredit or impeach such evidence and submit evidence rebutting same. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/34)  </p>
<p>Sec. 34. The determination by a circuit court that a licensee is subject to involuntary admission or judicial admission as provided in the "Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code", approved September 5, 1978, as now or hereafter amended operates as an automatic suspension. Such suspension will end only upon a finding by a court that the patient is no longer subject to involuntary admission or judicial admission and issues an order so finding and discharging the patient; and upon the recommendation of the Board to the Department that the licensee be allowed to resume his practice. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.1)  </p>

<p>Sec. 35.1.</p>

<p>(a) If any person violates the provision of this Act, the Secretary may, in the name of the People of the State of Illinois, through the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, or the State's Attorney of any county in which the action is brought, petition, for an order enjoining such violation or for an order enforcing compliance with this Act. Upon the filing of a verified petition in such court, the court may issue a temporary restraining order, without notice or bond, and may preliminarily and permanently enjoin such violation, and if it is established that such person has violated or is violating the injunction, the Court may punish the offender for contempt of court. Proceedings under this Section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other remedies and penalties provided by this Act.</p>

<p>(b) If any person shall practice as a pharmacist or hold himself out as a pharmacist or operate a pharmacy or drugstore, including a nonresident pharmacy under Section 16a, without being licensed under the provisions of this Act, then any licensed pharmacist, any interested party or any person injured thereby may, in addition to the Secretary, petition for relief as provided in subsection (a) of this Section. Whoever knowingly practices or offers to practice in this State without being appropriately licensed or registered under this Act shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and for each subsequent conviction, shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</p>

<p>(c) Whenever in the opinion of the Department any person not licensed in good standing under this Act violates any provision of this Act, the Department may issue a rule to show cause why an order to cease and desist should not be entered against him. The rule shall clearly set forth the grounds relied upon by the Department and shall provide a period of 7 days from the date of the rule to file an answer to the satisfaction of the Department. Failure to answer to the satisfaction of the Department shall cause an order to cease and desist to be issued forthwith.</p>

<p>Sec. 35.2. The Department's pharmacy investigators may investigate the actions of any applicant or of any person or persons holding or claiming to hold a license.

<p>Such written notice may be served by personal delivery, email to the respondent's email address of record, or mail to the respondent at his or her address of record. At the time and place fixed in the notice, the Board shall proceed to hear the charges and the parties or their counsel shall be accorded ample opportunity to present such statements, testimony, evidence and argument as may be pertinent to the charges or to the defense thereto. Such hearing may be continued from time to time.</p>

<p>In case the accused person, after receiving notice, fails to file an answer, his or her license may, in the discretion of the Secretary, having received first the recommendation of the Board, be suspended, revoked, placed on probationary status, or the Secretary may take whatever disciplinary action as he or she may deem proper as provided herein, including limiting the scope, nature, or extent of said person's practice, without a hearing, if the act or acts charged constitute sufficient grounds for such action under this Act. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.3)  </p>
<p>Sec. 35.3. The Department, at its expense, shall preserve a record of all proceedings at the formal hearing of any case involving the refusal to issue, renew or discipline of a license. The notice of hearing, complaint and all other documents in the nature of pleadings and written motions filed in the proceedings, the transcript of testimony, the report of the Board or hearing officer, exhibits, and orders of the Department shall be the record of such proceeding. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.4)  </p>
<p>Sec. 35.4. Any circuit court may, upon application of the Department or its designee or of the applicant or licensee against whom proceedings upon Section 35.2 of this Act are pending, enter an order requiring the attendance of witnesses and their testimony, and the production of documents, papers, files, books and records in connection with any hearing or investigation. The court may compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.5)  </p>
<p>Sec. 35.5. The Department shall have power to subpoena and bring before it any person in this State and to take testimony, either orally or by deposition or both, with the same fees and mileage and in the same manner as prescribed by law in judicial proceedings in civil cases in circuit courts of this State. The Department may subpoena and compel the production of documents, papers, files, books, and records in connection with any hearing or investigation. The Secretary, hearing officer, and any member of the Board, shall each have power to administer oaths to witnesses at any hearing which the Department is authorized to conduct under this Act, and any other oaths required or authorized to be administered by the Department hereunder.</p>

The report shall contain a finding whether or not the accused person violated this Act or failed to comply with the conditions required in this Act. The Board shall specify the nature of the violation or failure to comply, and shall make its recommendations to the Secretary. The report of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the Board shall be the basis for the Department's order or refusal or for the granting of a license. The finding is not admissible in evidence against the person in a criminal prosecution brought for the violation of this Act, but the hearing and finding are not a bar to a criminal prosecution brought for the violation of this Act. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.7)  </p>
<p>Sec. 35.7. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 35.6 of this Act, the Secretary shall have the authority to appoint any attorney duly licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois to serve as the hearing officer in any action before the Board for refusal to issue, renew, or discipline of a license. The hearing officer shall have full authority to conduct the hearing. There may be present one or more members of the Board at any such hearing. The hearing officer shall report his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations to the Board and the Secretary.</p>
<p>The Board shall have 60 days from receipt of the report to review the report of the hearing officer and present their findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations to the Secretary. If the Board fails to present its report within the 60-day period, the respondent or the Department may request in writing a direct appeal to the Secretary, in which case the Secretary may issue an order based upon the report of the hearing officer and the record of the proceedings or issue an order remanding the matter back to the hearing officer for additional proceedings in accordance with the order.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, if the Secretary, upon review, determines that substantial justice has not been done in the revocation, suspension, or refusal to issue or renew a license or other disciplinary action taken as the result of the entry of the hearing officer's report, the Secretary may order a rehearing by the same or other examiners. If the Secretary disagrees with the recommendation of the Board or the hearing officer, the Secretary may issue an order in contravention of the recommendation. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.8)  </p>
<p>Sec. 35.8.

Within 20 days after such service, the respondent may present to the Department a motion in writing for a rehearing, which motion shall specify the particular grounds therefor. If no motion for rehearing is filed, then upon the expiration of the time specified for filing such a motion, or if a motion for rehearing is denied, then upon such denial the Secretary may enter an order in accordance with recommendations of the Board except as provided in Section 35.6 or 35.7 of this Act. If the respondent shall order from the reporting service, and pay for a transcript of the record within the time for filing a motion for rehearing, the 20-day period within which such a motion may be filed shall commence upon the delivery of the transcript to the respondent. </p></div><div class="section"><p>(225 ILCS 85/35.9)  </p>
